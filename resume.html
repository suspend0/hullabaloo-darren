<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<p class="job"><b>Cedexis, Inc.</b> &#8211; August 2014 - present
(acquired&nbsp;by&nbsp;Citrix)</p>
<p>Principal Software Engineer.  Lead developer of the platform team,
responsible for the maintenance and growth of our internet-scale
DNS and HTTP services.</p>

<p>When I joined, the codebase was several years old but still in
startup mode: cross-dependencies and point solutions.  The
architecture was great; reliability and agility were suffering.
<ul>
  <li>Started and maintained the practice of code review, unit
      testing, and continual refactoring</li>
  <li>Reduced our set of supported languages to just C++, and
      normalized all the development and build environments</li>
  <li>Managed a zero-defect queue by maintaining low work-in-progress
      and focusing relentlessly on any customer-impacting bugs</li>
  <li>Drove down our release cycle from quarterly to weekly, leading
      directly to improved system reliability</li>
  <li>Decomposed a monolithic code base into half a dozen services,
      enabling faster iteration and safer deployments</li>
  <li>Lead service rewrites resulting in lower machine counts, in one
      case a reduction from 64 to 18 hosts</li>
  <li>Improved reliability to the point where the CEO stopped showing
      the "Customer Impacting Downtime" side in all-hands</li>
</ul>
These services together handle 15 billion requests per day, about
evenly split between DNS and HTTP.  They run on approx 200 machines
in six cloud providers.  My team runs 12 services, which in turn use
a similar number of shared code modules.
<ul>
  <li>Reduced memory requirements by rewriting core data structures,
      in one case from 8GB/service to 1.5GB/service</li>
  <li>Dropped p99 latency 80% (!) by replacing a central lock with
      atomic updates plus a form of garbage collection (QSBR)</li>
  <li>Replaced a kafka/spark cluster running on AWS with some bash
      scripts, lowering operational costs by 75% and reducing the
      need for specialized training</li>
  <li>Transitioned our transaction database from PostgreSQL to BigQuery,
      including a rewrite of the HTTP API to make it possible for
      portal to remove embedded SQL</li>
  <li>Ported away from bespoke threading, http, JavaScript, and similar
      infrastructure code to off-the-shelf libraries</li>
  <li>Rewrote global configuration glue code from python to C++,
      dropping SLOC by 2/3 and reducing update latency from 3 minutes
      to 20 seconds for our 40 global data centers</li>
  <li>Split a single large common-code library into single-purpose
      modules, making source-level dependencies clear at build
      definition time</li>
  <li>I learned C++ for this job</li>
</ul>
