Senior Software Engineer
</p>
<p>As Senior Software Engineer on the Architecture Team at Jive, I was
responsible for moving the Jive platform forward. This is a programming
position focused on the underpinnings of the application: login, caching
system, clustering, data access, permissions and similar. I lead a redesign and
reimplementation of the permissions system. This included an implementation on
a "NoSQL" data store (HBase).</p>

<p>Technologies: Java, HBase, Voldemort, Guice, Kafka, JSON, Protobuf, Spring</p>

<p><b>Tripwire, Inc.</b><br>

Senior Software Engineer</p>

<p>Upon exit, I lead architecture and programming practices at Tripwire. I
designed and implemented a message-passing architecture, and supported 30
developers and three development managers in its implementation. I championed
the introduction of inversion-of-control, enforced API separation, layered
component design and event-based systems.</p>

<p>Earlier, I was focused on tactical rewrites of core components for
performance, including algorithm parallelization, network optimization,
concurrency whack-a- mole and database tuning. Also designed a data warehouse,
and lead a team of C++ developers.</p>

<p>Technologies: Java, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Protobuf, REST, Guice</p>

<p><b>Fujitsu America</b><br>
May 2002 - April 2007 (4 years 6 months)<br>
Software Engineer<br>
</p>

<p>Designed and implemented software for global website consolidation across
all Fujitsu countries and business-units to www.fujitsu.com. I was responsible
for overall architecture of the application, including software selection,
functional specifications, schedule, implementation plan and final delivery.
Led multiple iterations of the project, implemented code review and coding
standards, established unit testing and component development. Planned and
managed successful transition to JBoss clustered application server.</p>

<p>The software supports webmasters in over 35 countries and languages. I have
a deep understanding of internationalization and localization, global
communication and large-scale deployments.</p>

<p>Technologies: Java, JMS, XML, XML Schema, XSLT, Oracle, Oracle PL/SQL and of course Perl.</p>

applications. I was employee #4 at Consonus.</p>
